### package the rails application to gem
### use gem to generate a website against the database


It's a rails application with mysql DB. Don't ask me why, that's all I have.


1. install ruby and rails


2. Execute the script to have your own site

        $ shell

3. I have attached a script for the example database. you can change it with your data.

        $ install example db
